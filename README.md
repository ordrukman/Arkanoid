# Arkanoid
Arkanoid GameProject

A version of the Arkanoid game, as part of the OOP course, during my Computer Science studies degree.
The game contains various levels with increasing difficulty, in a GUI-friendly platform.
I implemented the game with Java language and using many OOP principles.
4 levels.
